 * Reconciles a version mismatch between `@ai-sdk/mcp` and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` at our
 * transport seam. After the initialize handshake, `@ai-sdk/mcp`'s `init()` records the negotiated
 * protocol via the *direct assignment* `this.transport.protocolVersion = result.protocolVersion`
 * (see @ai-sdk/mcp dist `init()`). But `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (>=1.25) made `protocolVersion`
 * a getter-only accessor on `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` and exposes a `setProtocolVersion()`
 * setter instead — so the direct assignment throws
 * `TypeError: Cannot set property protocolVersion ... which has only a getter`, breaking every
 * remote (http/sse) MCP connect. The SDK's own client uses `transport.setProtocolVersion(...)`.
 *
 * No stable `@ai-sdk/mcp` release fixes the assignment (it persists through 1.0.45; only the
 * AI-SDK-v6 `2.0.0-beta` line drops it, which would force a major upgrade of our v5 AI SDK stack),
 * and the getter-only accessor exists across our whole declared `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` range —
 * so the proper, minimal fix lives here, where we own the transport. We shadow the getter-only
 * accessor with a settable instance accessor that delegates writes to the SDK's own
 * `setProtocolVersion()`, leaving reads unchanged.
