 *   1. Disconnect PowerSync (best-effort — log + continue on failure).
 *   2. Broadcast `db-closing` so other tabs drop their handles before the file disappears.
 *   3. Close the DB connection in this tab.
 *   4. Delete the active trust domain's DB file from OPFS / Tauri app data.
 *   5. Broadcast `db-deleted` (informational — other tabs already reloaded on step 2).
 *   6. Clear the active server's namespaced auth token + device ID.
 *   7. Clear `thunderbolt-keys__<serverId>` encryption keys + reset codec cache.
 *
 * Standalone trust domains skip the auth-token / encryption-key steps (no server →
 * nothing namespaced). The DB file (`standalone.db`) is still removed.
 *
 * Does NOT reload or navigate — callers do that explicitly.
 *
 * The `deps` parameter exists for testing: pass mock functions to observe the call
 * sequence without mocking shared modules globally.
