/**
 * Hover-shows / hover-stays card anchored to a slash token in the chat
 * input overlay. We use Radix `HoverCard` rather than a hand-rolled
 * `Popover` + mouse-timer pair because the latter ping-pongs when the
 * popover content overlaps the trigger — closing the content makes the
 * cursor "re-enter" the trigger and re-open immediately. HoverCard
 * handles the trigger ↔ content boundary correctly.
 *
 * Desktop: hover the colored token → card opens after ~`openDelay` ms and
 * stays open while the cursor is inside the trigger or the content;
 * leaving both with no immediate re-entry closes it.
 *
 * Mobile: HoverCard primitive on touch devices opens on tap; tapping the
 * card backdrop closes it. The `Link` inside is tap-targetable.
 *
 * The trigger span is `pointer-events-auto` so it can capture hover even
 * though the surrounding overlay is `pointer-events-none` (the textarea
 * underneath must stay interactive).
