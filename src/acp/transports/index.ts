/**
 * Transport factory. WebSocket is the only supported remote ACP transport.
 *
 * Routing by agent type:
 *   - `managed-acp` (Haystack and other server-managed agents): native
 *     WebSocket direct to the URL with the bearer token attached as a
 *     `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` entry. The endpoint is hosted on the cloud
 *     backend (e.g. `/v1/haystack/ws`), so whenever an authenticated
 *     `httpClient` is available we offer the bearer regardless of the proxy
 *     toggle — that toggle only governs external-traffic routing, not auth
 *     against the backend itself. Tunnelling through the universal proxy is
 *     wrong on two counts: the proxy rejects same-origin and `ws://` targets,
 *     and the extra hop would strip the credential. The path falls back to a
 *     direct, unauthenticated connect only when no `httpClient` is wired
 *     (true Standalone — no backend reachable).
 *   - `remote-acp` (user-configured external agents): Connected vs Standalone
 *     is layered orthogonally:
 *       - Web (always Connected): proxied WebSocket via `createProxyWebSocket`.
 *       - Tauri + proxy toggle ON  (Connected):  proxied WebSocket.
 *       - Tauri + proxy toggle OFF (Standalone): native `new WebSocket()`.
 *
 * The effective proxy value is read from `computeEffectiveProxyEnabled` so the
 * factory matches the rest of the codebase (one source of truth).
