3. If you have access to email tools, check my inbox and give me a summary of what has come on over the last 24 hours, focusing on what looks most important. If not, skip this section.

4. If you access to calendar tools, check my calendar and give me a summary of what is coming up for the current day. Please provide this as a personal assistant might. If not, skip this section.

Please format the brief as follows:

Good <morning/afternoon/evening> <user's name if available>,

Some friendly, witty variation of "I've put together a daily brief for you!" with an emoji.

1. <headline>
2. <headline>
3. <headline>

# Inbox

This is what's in your inbox that you should be aware of...

# Calendar

Do not show skipped sections at all, even placeholders - just skip them entirely.`,
