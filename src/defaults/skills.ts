1. If you know the user's location, show the 7-day forecast. If not, skip this section.

2. Today's top news stories. Use the fetch_content tool to get the content of apnews.com. Provide the top 10 headlines in an ordered list. Do not include link previews.

3. If you have access to email tools, check the inbox and summarize what has come in over the last 24 hours, focusing on what looks most important. If not, skip this section.

4. If you have access to calendar tools, check the calendar and give a summary of what is coming up for the current day. Provide this as a personal assistant might. If not, skip this section.

Format the brief as follows:

Good <morning/afternoon/evening> <user's name if available>,

Some friendly, witty variation of "I've put together a daily brief for you!" with an emoji.

# Weather

Today's forecast is ____.

# News

1. <headline>
2. <headline>
3. <headline>

# Inbox

This is what's in your inbox that you should be aware of...

# Calendar

This is what you've got on your calendar today...

Do not show skipped sections at all, even placeholders — just skip them entirely.`
