   * SQL — a nested `BEGIN` is a no-op (Postgres warning), but the matching
   * `COMMIT` ends the outer test transaction, breaking isolation.
   *
   * Against a Drizzle Transaction, `db.transaction(...)` uses `SAVEPOINT`
   * instead, which nests cleanly and rolls back with the outer test
   * transaction on cleanup.
   *
   * The outer transaction is opened via a deferred promise so we can hand
   * the Transaction object to the caller and hold it open until cleanup.
   * Throwing a sentinel from inside the transaction callback triggers
   * Drizzle's `ROLLBACK`; the catch outside swallows the sentinel.
