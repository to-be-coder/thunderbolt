Event tracking respects user privacy settings and can be disabled through the application settings. No personally identifiable information is collected without explicit user consent.

## Event Tracking

Thunderbolt uses PostHog for analytics to track user interactions and application usage. All events follow a structured naming convention for better organization and analysis.

### Event Naming Convention

Events follow the pattern: `<feature>_<action>`

- **Feature**: The main area of the application (e.g., `chat`, `task`, `automation`)
- **Action**: The specific action being performed (e.g., `send_prompt`, `add`, `create`)

### Event Categories

#### Chat & Messaging (`chat_*`)

- `chat_send_prompt` - User sends a message to the AI
- `chat_receive_reply` - AI generates a response
- `chat_select` - User selects a chat thread
- `chat_new_clicked` - User creates a new chat
- `chat_delete` - User deletes a chat
- `chat_clear_all` - User clears all chats

#### Model Management (`model_*`)

- `model_select` - User selects a different AI model

#### Agents (`agent_*`)

- `agent_select` - User selects a different agent for a chat thread
- `agent_seal_hit` - User pressed `/` in a thread bound to a sealed company agent or a personal ACP agent (which have no skills surface). A P2 demand signal for extensibility on sealed agents; fired once alongside the one-time educational note.
- `agent_grant_received` - Fired once (per app session) per newly-granted team agent id the first time the member sees it — the one-time "grant received" highlight rendered in BOTH the composer agent selector and the Agents page. Payload: `{ agentId }`. Health/demand signal for grant delivery.
- `agent_manage_library_tap` - Member tapped "Manage in Library →" from an agent context (agents-page-spec §6). Payload: `{ agentKind, agentId }`. Demand signal for reintroducing per-agent config.

#### Model Usage (server-side, `$ai_generation`)

Per-user model-usage attribution (T4) is captured server-side by the `@posthog/ai`
wrapper as its auto-emitted `$ai_generation` event, carrying token **usage** plus
`posthogDistinctId` = the invoking user's id (set in
`backend/src/inference/routes.ts` via `buildInferenceTelemetry`). Conversation
content is stripped by the wrapper's privacy mode. This feeds the future v2
token/usage dashboard; there is no v1 UI. No capture occurs when PostHog is not
configured.

#### Settings (`settings_*`)

- `settings_theme_set` - User changes the application theme
- `settings_name_set` - User sets their preferred name initially
- `settings_name_update` - User updates their preferred name
- `settings_name_clear` - User clears their preferred name
- `settings_location_set` - User sets their location initially
- `settings_location_update` - User updates their location
- `settings_localization_update` - User updates localization settings (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, time format, language)
- `settings_database_reset` - User resets the application database
- `settings_data_collection_enabled` - User enables data collection
- `settings_data_collection_disabled` - User disables data collection

#### Task Management (`task_*`)

- `task_add` - User adds a new task
- `task_mark_complete` - User marks a task as complete
- `task_update_text` - User edits task text
- `task_reorder` - User reorders tasks
- `task_search` - User searches through tasks

#### Automation (`automation_*`)

- `automation_modal_create_open` - Create automation modal opens
- `automation_create` - New automation is created
- `automation_modal_edit_open` - Edit automation modal opens
- `automation_update` - Existing automation is updated
- `automation_run` - Automation is executed
- `automation_delete_clicked` - Delete automation button is clicked
- `automation_delete_confirmed` - Automation deletion is confirmed

#### Content View & Preview (`content_view_*`, `preview_*`)

- `content_view_open` - Content view opens (with properties: `view_type`, `tool_name` for object views, `sideview_type` for sideviews)
- `content_view_close` - Content view closes (with property: `view_type`)
- `preview_open` - Preview webview opens from a link click
- `preview_close` - Preview webview closes
- `preview_copy_url` - User copies URL from preview header
- `preview_open_external` - User opens preview URL in external browser

#### UI & Navigation (`ui_*`)

- `ui_shortcut_use` - User uses a keyboard shortcut
- `ui_sidebar_open` - Sidebar opens
- `ui_sidebar_close` - Sidebar closes

#### Startup Performance (`app_*`)

Diagnostic events for investigating app initialization time. All timing values are whole milliseconds measured from navigation start (`performance.timeOrigin`).

- `app_init_timing` - Fired once per initialization run, after the init pipeline completes. Properties:
  - `bundle_evaluated_ms` - entry bundle downloaded, parsed and evaluated
  - `app_mounted_ms` - first render of the root React component
  - `step0_fetch_config_ms` … `step8_initialize_posthog_ms` - duration of each init step (including `step2b_db_ready_ms` — the first trivial query that pays PowerSync's deferred ready gate — plus `step4b_run_data_migrations_ms` and `step6_create_http_client_ms`)
  - `init_total_ms` - total pipeline duration
  - `init_run` - run counter (greater than 1 means the user retried after an init error)
  - `initial_sync_outcome` - how the initial-sync gate resolved: `disabled`, `synced`, `timed_out` or `failed`
  - `sync_enabled`, `platform` - segmentation context
- `app_chat_ready` - Fired at most once per session when the first chat finishes hydrating (with `chat_ready_ms`). Together with `app_init_timing`, this captures the user-perceived time to a usable chat.

#### Sync Diagnostics (`sync_*`)

Diagnostic events for debugging sync issues (especially iOS). All events include shared context: `platform`, `ps_config`, `ps_connected`, `ps_connecting`, `ps_has_synced`, `ps_last_synced_at`, `ps_uploading`, `ps_downloading`, `uptime_ms`.

- `sync_connect` - PowerSync connected successfully
- `sync_connect_error` - PowerSync connection failed (with `error`)
- `sync_disconnect` - PowerSync disconnected (with `trigger`: `'user'` or `'reconnect'`)
- `sync_reconnect_start` - Reconnect attempt started (with `trigger`: `'visibility'` or `'manual'`)
- `sync_reconnect_success` - Reconnect succeeded (with optional `hidden_duration_ms`)
- `sync_reconnect_error` - Reconnect failed (with `error`, `trigger`)
- `sync_visibility_change` - App visibility changed (with `state`, `hidden_duration_ms`, `will_reconnect`, `ms_since_last_download`)
- `sync_credentials_fetch` - Token refresh succeeded (with `expires_in_ms`)
- `sync_credentials_error` - Token refresh failed (with `status`, `error_code`, `had_token`)
- `sync_upload` - CRUD upload succeeded (with `operation_count`)
- `sync_upload_error` - CRUD upload failed (with `error`, `operation_count`)
- `sync_status_change` - PowerSync connected↔disconnected transition (with `prev_connected`, `ms_since_last_change`)

### Implementation

Events are tracked using the `trackEvent` function from `src/lib/posthog.tsx`:

```typescript
import { trackEvent } from '@/lib/posthog'

// Track a simple event
trackEvent('chat_send_prompt')

// Track an event with properties
trackEvent('chat_send_prompt', {
  model: 'gpt-4',
  length: 150,
})
```

### Type Safety

All event names are typed using the `EventType` union type, ensuring:

- Only valid event names can be used
- Autocomplete support in IDEs
- Compile-time error checking for typos

### Adding New Events

To add a new event:

1. Add the event name to the `EventType` union in `src/lib/posthog.tsx`
2. Use the `<feature>_<action>` naming convention
3. Add the tracking call in the appropriate component
4. Include relevant properties for analytics insights
5. Update this file to document it
